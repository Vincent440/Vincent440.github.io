                <p class ="biopara"> My full name is Vincent Shury, However I prefer to just be called Vince. I am entirely new to computer programming,the only computer language I tried to learn before was Python and I did not get very far. I'm very confident with this course I will learn many new computer languages and the tools I need to be a great developer, 
                 (Google & W3 Schools). One thing I am familiar with is computer hardware, as of now I am on my fifth computer build, however
                 I still need a graphics card for my computer but I am not worried about that just yet with all this time I need for web developement. (I am just waiting for the new line of AMD GPUs.)

                <p class ="biopara"> Outside of computers I love the outdoors and camping. As of 2017 I am a motorcycle rider who enjoys riding whenever there is a clear nice day. I have all the gear I need to keep me safe and dry on my rides just about any day of the year.
                 When it comes to camping I always opt to use a lightweight hammock with a cover. The hammock is super light and easy to set up without having to stay on the ground on those wet days! I am looking forward to those clear starry summer nights.
